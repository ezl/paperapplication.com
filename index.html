<p>The future is now. There's no denying that we live in an age where technology is changing the way we all do business.  Real estate as an industry is no different and it's imperative that we adapt.</p>
<p>With our online printable PDF application, you'll be able to print your applications <strong><em>ON DEMAND</em></strong>!</p>

<p>In a world of viruses, hackers, crackers, spam, and other assorted possibly dangerous things that sound like food products, digital ANYTHING has unknown risks. It's a proven fact that real estate is risk free, so we need a risk free application process.</p>

<p>Paper is tried and true and Americans have been using paper rental applications for over 4 <strong><em>BILLION</em></strong> years (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">It's just science</a>).</p>

<p><strong>If you're ready to join the PAPER REVOLUTION, read on!</strong></p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Minimal Incremental Environmental Impact</h3>

<p>Now, some of the naysayers will say you're contributing to a pollution problem and that they're going <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">"green"</span> by going digital.</p>

<p>Well you might be using a little paper, but that's a small price to pay for the security of paper. And your marginal impact is VERY low -- here are the numbers.</p>
<p>Approximately 100 million rental applications are processed per year in the United States of America. With an average of 6 pages of physical paper used per process, that's:</p>
<ul>
    <li>600 million <strong>sheets of paper</strong> (about 15,000,000 pounds)</li>
    <li>83,500,000 <strong>kilowatt hours of energy</strong> used to produce that (enough to power an average American household for 6,250 years)</li>
    <li>27,250 metric <strong>tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emmissions</strong> (That's a lot, just trust us)</li>
    <li>1.8 BILLION <strong>gallons of water</strong> used (515 million toilet flushes)</li>
    <li>201,000 <strong>printer ink cartriges</strong> at 3.5 pounds each of solid waste and packaging that go into landfills, taking 600 to 1000 years each to decompose</li>
    <li>17.09 million more <strong>pounds of solid waste</strong> that goes into the production of the paper used</li>
    <li>Some experts also believe that <strong>a few trees</strong> get cut down in the process</li>
</ul>

<p>However, as an independent small company or property manager, your marginal impact is miniscule. Each individual company barely even moves the needle!</p>

<p>Given that there's very little impact you <strong>individually</strong> can make globally by switching to <a href="https://www.rentapplication.net" target="_blank">digital/online applications</a>, there's really no incentive to get off of paper (except for access anywhere, automated reporting, integrated screening, online payment processing of credit cards, no more paper checks and bank runs, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>OK Already! We're already sold on the PAPER REVOLUTION, Let's GO!</strong></p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Property Management At The Speed of Mail</h3>

<p>Mail. It's fucking fast.</p>
<p>The speed of message delivery has increased dramatically over the course of human history. Note the time to deliver a message 150 miles by each of the following methods:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Method</th>
            <th>Invented/Commonly Used</th>
            <th>Speed</th>
            <th>Time to travel 150 miles</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Walking</td>         <td>invented when Adam left the Garden of Eden</td><td>4 mph</td><td>37.5 hours </td></tr>
        <tr><td>Running</td>         <td>invented by Al Gore in 1800 BC</td><td>15 mph</td><td>10 hours</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Carrier Pigeon</td>  <td>used by Ancient Persians</td><td>37 mph</td><td> 4.05 hours</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Horseback</td>       <td>historical record as early as 1274 AD</td><td>55 mph</td><td>2.72 hours</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Automobile</td>      <td>1886 </td><td>85 mph:</td><td>1.76 hours</td></tr> 
        <tr><td>Airplane</td>        <td>first commercial air flight in 1945 </td><td>600+ mph</td><td>15 minutes</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Simply extrapolating leads inevitably to the scientific conclusion that mail will soon be able to be delivered in negative time. We should shortly expect technological advances that will allow the receiver to read the message <strong><em>before</em></strong> it is sent!</p>

<p><strong>You pay taxes for the postal service. You might as well use it.</strong></p>
